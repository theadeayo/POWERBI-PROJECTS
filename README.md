# Process:
## Dataset Transformation
#### Pre-Loading Adjustments : Attached is the raw dataset used or view here üëâ [financial_data.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18391392/financial_data.csv)

These were the transformations implemented on the datasets to derive the resulted dashboard
1.  Removed the ‚Äú$‚Äù symbols from the below columns
    - Units Sold, Manufacturing Prices, Sales Price, Gross Sales, Sales, Discount, COGS & Profit
2.  Changed the data type of the above columns to Whole Numbers
3.  Replaced ‚Äú-‚Äù to ‚Äú0‚Äù in the discount column to avoid Errors
4.  Replaced the Error rows in the Profit Column to 0 for data validity
5.  Created a new date column to change the format from MM/DD/YYYY to DD/MM/YYYY
    - Regenerated Columns Month, Quarter and Year
6. Added prefix ‚ÄúQ‚Äù to the quarter column
#### Post Loading Adjustments
1. Due to the high volume of transaction-level data, grouping by Year and Quarter was necessary to provide aggregated insights and improve performance in visualizations
2. Disabled Auto Date Hierarchy creation and refreshed
3. Created custom Date Hierarchy and added grouped years and quarters to the date hierarchy to aid visualizations and drilling

# Visualizations
#### Below are the visual elements utilized
